* Install and navigate to vscode `settings` or `settings.json` page.
* Set `"ignoreit.array": [".env", "*.pem"]` to include the files and folders you'd always want to ignore. Feel free to modify it anytime.
* If any of the files or folders specified in the array exists in your project directory, `ignoreit` extension will add it to the `.gitignore` file.
* If `.gitignore` file does not exist in your project directory, `ignoreit` extension will create a `.gitignore` file and fill in the files you're to ignore.
* The `.gitignore` content will be the files in your project directory that corresponds to the `ignoreit.array`
* You can manually add other files to the `.gitignore` file. New files are always appended to the existing ones.
* If `.env` file is part of the files in your directory, `ignoreit` extension will optionally create a `.env.example` file and fill it with the the truncated contents of your .env file, if `"ignoreit.updateEnvExample": true` - only variables are filled in, values are left behind. The `.env` and `.env.example` files will always be in sync.
* You can use wildcards to specify files ending in certain patterns (example: `"*.pem"`)

## Extension Settings

`ignoreit.array` should exist as one of the keys in your VSCODE `settings.json` file, and the value should be an array of the files you wish to automatically add to `.gitignore` file in all your project (if the files or folders exist in your project). See example below

```json
"ignoreit.array": [".env", "*.pem", "node_modules", "coverage"]
```
